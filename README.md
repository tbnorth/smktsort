# smktsort

An app. to sort a shopping list according to supermarket layout
for efficient shopping.

Given a file defining the layout of a supermarket as an ordered
list of aisles and other sections, helps you sort your list to pick
up everything in order in one run through - useful or sometimes even
enforced in COVID-19 shopping scenarios.
